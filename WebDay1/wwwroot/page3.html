    <p>My <a href="https://github.com/MikeDuBose/MidTerm">midterm</a> was a success, scoring 95 out of a possible 100 points.  The thing I liked most about the project
    is the extended challenge.  Having never really worked with a web front or back end, I challenged myself to tap into the IMDB database to query movies.  I was able to 
    complete this by pulling the most popular pages and dynamically displaying their titles and movie-art.
