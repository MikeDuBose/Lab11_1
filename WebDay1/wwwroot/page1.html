    <h2 class="subsection-header">Who I Am</h2>
    <p class="font">
        I'm a thirty year old United States Navy veteran just trying to make my way in the world.  I am currently lucky enough to be employed
        by Quicken Loans as an Associate Software Engineer in Training.  I am currently half-way through the training program put forth by Quicken Loans.  I currently
        enjoy hanging out alone and about 6 feet away from other humans.  I enjoy plenty of recreational activites that are legal in Michigan including skydiving,
        disc golfing, Animal Crossing, and camping.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subsection-header">Where I'm From</h2>
    <p class="font">
        I'm from nowhere, really.  Both of my parents (and their parents before them) joined the Navy in the mid-eighties.  With both of them
        serving in active duty, we generally moved around every 2 years or so; so when someone asks me where I'm from, I usually tell them "Detroit", even though
        I'd like nothing more than to leave this city.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subsection-header">Where I'm Going</h2>
    <p class="font">
        I'm currently learning everything I can about software development through Quicken Loans' 'Dev.Build()' program.  The program is a 20 week course that partners
        with Grand Circus to provide the ultimate coding bootcamp.  After this completes, I'm looking forward to landing a spot on an actual development team and getting
        to work!
